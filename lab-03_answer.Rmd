## Motivation

Last week, we reviewed linear regression - the workhorse model of a Marketing Analyst's toolkit.
When linear regression is further combined with the ability to conduct experiments or find 'natural experiments', the analyst's toolkit is further strengthened through their ability to make **strong** causal claims about the effect of marketing interventions through the use of the Difference-in-Differences (DiD) methodology.

In this tutorial you will apply the DiD methodology to get first hand experience with these tools.
We will focus both on how to implement them in `R` and how to correctly interpret the results.
The empirical example demonstrates how to use the DiD toolkit to evaluate the effectiveness of search engine marketing on sales revenue of an online company.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this tutorial you will be able to:

1. Estimate treatment effects of a marketing intervention using difference in difference estimates from differences in group averages.
2. Estimate treatment effects of a marketing intervention using difference in difference estimates from linear regression.
3. Critically evaluate the assumptions required for difference in difference estimates to be valid.
4. Correctly interpret difference in difference regression estimates.
5. Display difference in difference estimates in a regression table and coefficient plot.

## Exercise 1: Difference in Differences

In 2014, [Thomas Blake](http://www.tomblake.net/), [Chris Nosko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cnosko) and [Steve Tadelis](https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/stadelis/) published a study that examines the revenue impact of search engine marketing.^[
  Read the paper [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/ECTA12423).
  It's a bit of a timeless classic in my opinion.
]
Essentially, they worked with eBay to run controlled experiments and turn off search engine marketing in certain parts of the USA and examine the effects on revenue in these regions compared to other regions where marketing was kept on.
eBay (like many other companies) intensively used search engine marketing by bidding on different keywords on Google's [AdWords platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Ads).
<!-- The working assumption at the time was that these ads placed on Google's Search and non-search websites steer consumers to a company and increase sales (and thus revenue). -->

For 8 weeks following May 22nd, 2012, eBay stopped using search engine marketing in a treatment group of 65 out of 210 Designated Market Areas in the USA.^[
  A DMA is a region in the USA where the population receives the same (or similar) TV and radio offerings, and internet content.
]
eBay then tracked the revenues in each DMA (treatment and control) using the shipping address of customers.
The question Blake, Nosko and Tadelis wanted to answer was whether turning off search engine marketing changed eBay's revenue. 
We want to replicate their analyses using a modified version of their original data.^[
  [Matt Taddy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-taddy-433078137) makes this data available as part of his book [Business Data Science](http://taddylab.com/BDS.html). 
  The data has been scaled and translated so that eBay's actual revenues remain unknown, but the transformed data give similar results to the analysis on real data.
  Any effect we find in our analysis will look very similar to the original paper.
]

To gain access to the data, run the following code to download it and save it in the file `data/paid_search.csv`:

```{r, cache= TRUE}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TaddyLab/BDS/master/examples/paidsearch.csv"
# where to save data
out_file <- "data/paid_search.csv"
# download it!
download.file(url, destfile = out_file, mode = "wb")
```

You might need to use the following `R` libraries throughout this exercise:^[
    If you haven't installed one or more of these packages, do so by entering `install.packages("PKG_NAME")` into the R console and pressing ENTER.

1. What is search engine advertising?
  Explain the mechanisms through which it might ultimately influence sales revenue.

*Write your answer here*
  
2. Why would it be difficult to estimate the effectiveness of search engine advertising with purely observational data?

*Write your answer here*

3. Explain why the experiment that Blake, Nosko and Tadelis runs allows them to avoid the issues in (2), and accurately measure the causal effect of search engine advertising on sales.

*Write your answer here*

With some conceptual knowledge under our belt, let's get our hands dirty.
We will start by cleaning up the data a little and then producing some summary plots to build up an understanding of the main patterns.

4. Load the data into `R` naming the data `paidsearch`.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


5. What are the column names in the data? 
If you find that one of the column names in the data has whitespace in it, you will want to replace the whitespace with underscores, "`_`"

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


6. Revenue is reported in USD.
Modify the `revenue` variable so that the new values are in '000s of USD.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


To draw some descriptive plots we will need the `date` variable to be formatted as a date (rather than as a character string).
Run the following code to make this conversion:

```{r}
# Uncomment these lines by removing the #'s
# in front of the code when you get to this point
# paidsearch <-
#     paidsearch %>%
#     mutate(date  = as_date(date, format = '%d-%b-%y'))
```


7. Compute the average revenue per DMA each day.
Plot the data so that you can see how average revenue evolves over time.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


The plot in (7) likely shows a lot of cyclicality within each week.
This makes it hard to visualize broader patterns or differences across groups. 
We will compute averages for each calendar week to smooth out the cyclicality within each week.
To make this easier, run the following code to extract the calendar week from each date in the data:

```{r}
# Uncomment these lines by removing the #'s
# in front of the code when you get to this point
#paidsearch <-
#    paidsearch %>%
#    mutate(calweek = week(date))
```


8. Compute the average daily revenue per calendar week for DMAs in which eBay turn off their search advertising and for DMAs that leave search advertising turned on.
The resulting dataset should have 34 observations, 17 where `search_stays_on =1` and 17 where `search_stays_on =0`.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


9. Plot the average daily revenue per week for`search_stays_on =1` and  `search_stays_on =0`.
Add a vertical line denoting where the experiment begins (22 May 2012).
Your final plot should resemble this one:

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align="center", out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/ebay_experiment.png')
```


```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


10. Is average revenue different for DMAs that have turned off search advertising compared to those where it remains on?
Why might this be the case?

*Write your answer here*

11. From the graph above, can you "eye-conometrically" see any effect of turning off search engine ads?^[
  All "clean" (well-executed) Difference in Difference papers should produce a plot where you can visually assess what is going on.
  If you don't see one, its could a warning sign that whatever comes next is an artifact of the statistical model, rather than the experiment (or, if published in a journal *maybe* an editor asked to suppress the figure to save space).
]

*Write your answer here*


Now we will go back to working with the full dataset `paidsearch`.

12. Create a new variable `treatment` that takes the value 1 if search engine advertising is switched off, and 0 if search engine advertising stays on.
Also rename the variable `treatment_period` to `after`.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


13. We can compute a Difference in Difference estimate from a set of group means:

$$
\hat{\delta}_{DiD} = (\bar{y}_{after=1}^{treat =1} - \bar{y}_{after=0}^{treat =1}) - (\bar{y}_{after=1}^{treat =0} - \bar{y}_{after=0}^{treat=0})
$$

where $\bar{y}$ is average revenue, `after=1` denotes dates after the treatment starts, `after=0` denotes dates before the treatment starts, `treat=1` denotes DMAs that where part of the treatment group and `treat=0` denotes DMAS that where part of the control group.
Thus $\bar{y}_{after=1, treat =1}$ is average revenue for DMAs in the treatment group for the period after the treatment has begun.

Compute each of these four $\bar{y}$'s.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


14. Use the averages you computed in (13) to the treatment effect of turning off search engine advertising, i.e. $\hat{\beta}_{DiD}$.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


15. Interpret the effect you computed from the point of view of a marketing analyst working at eBay. Is it large from a marketing viewpoint?

*Write your answer here*

16. We rarely see analytical work use this difference in averages approach.
Can you explain why that might be the case?

*Write your answer here*

17. Estimate a linear regression that computes the equivalent Difference-in-Difference estimate as (13).

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


18. Is $\hat{\beta}_{DiD}$ statistically significant? How can you tell?

*Write your answer here*

19. We can repeat the estimation in (17) using $\log(revenue)$ rather than $revenue$. Why might we want to do that?
Run this regression and interpret the magnitude of the treatment effect.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


20. What standard errors were computed with your regression estimates so far?
Are these appropriate? 
If not, adjust them to compute what you believe to be more conservative (and unbiased) standard error estimates.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```

21. Do you think fixed effects should be added into the regression? Why?
Add them to your regression and report the results.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```

22. Construct a regression table that presents three or more of the regressions you have run.
Make it look presentable, such that you could use it in a presentation to eBay stakeholders if you were in the shoes of Blake, Nosko and Tadelis.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```

23. Construct a coefficient plot that presents the difference in difference estimates of three or more of the regressions you have run.
Make it look presentable, such that you could use it in as an alternative to the regression table in presentation to eBay stakeholders if you were in the shoes of Blake, Nosko and Tadelis.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```

24. A crucial assumption for the Difference-in-Differences estimate to accurately measure the effect of turning off search engine ads is the presence of parallel trends.
What is the parallel trends assumption and why do we need it?
Does it appear satisfied in our data?

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


25. Can we definitively conclude from the results above that search engine marketing does not pay off? Explain your answer.

*Write your answer here*
